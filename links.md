This site contains reading material that can help you a lot in review the first week's material. 
There are several sub-chapters such as what operating systems is, dual-mode operation, os structure, etc.

2. [WEEK 01](https://www.notion.so/Lecture-02-Virtual-Machines-b1c91dde244f43c686fd86fd9978abb8) <br>
In week 01, we learn about emulation, virtualisation, types of VMMs, Implementing Virtualisation, and Virtualisation Problems.
I highly recommend this site for those of you who have a penchant for learning through visuals like me.
