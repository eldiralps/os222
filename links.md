1. [WEEK 00](https://www.notion.so/Lecture-01-Introduction-6a6c00684cc5412a93f430014a9a81e5#971b70590fad4c37861c4c37d0524b14)<br>
This site contains reading material that can help you a lot in review the first week's material. 
There are several sub-chapters such as what operating systems is, dual-mode operation, os structure, etc.

2. [WEEK 01](https://www.notion.so/Lecture-02-Virtual-Machines-b1c91dde244f43c686fd86fd9978abb8) <br>
In week 01, we learn about emulation, virtualisation, types of VMMs, Implementing Virtualisation, and Virtualisation Problems.
I highly recommend this site for those of you who have a penchant for learning through visuals like me.

3. [WEEK 02 - Types of Cyber Attacks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk-ZqQ-bfy4) <br>
This video will give you more information about the most common types of cyber attacks. Eight most frequently cyber threats in the world are malware, phishing, password attacks, DDoS, Man in the middle, drive-by download, malvertising, and rouge software.

4. [WEEK 02 - Pros and Cons of BYOD](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVNDl7ig1mk) <br>
An example of BYOD in real life is an employee who is allowed to use his personal device for both official work in the office and personal use. One of the benefits of implementing this policy is that BYOD can increase employee productivity, but on the other hand, if an employee loses his personal device, then attackers can easily get company information.

5. [WEEK 03 - File System Structure Articles](https://www.notion.so/Lecture-20-File-System-Structure-and-File-Links-f84da2a1bfe24d129f6e07620084ee68) <br>
Data about files and other info about storage on a device is called metadata. Usually, a disk device has one or more directories (or tables) to store metadata. These directories can be arranged in different ways such as single-level, two-level, tree stuctured, etc.

7. [WEEK 03 - Basic File Encryption](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMGIlj7u7Eo) <br>
This tutorial can help you to encrypt files with GPG key pairs.

8. [WEEK 04 - Memory Management](https://www.massey.ac.nz/~mjjohnso/notes/59305/mod8.html) <br>
Program must be brought into memory and placed within a process for it to be executed. The binding of instructions and data to the memory addresses can be done at any of the following steps of program execution which is complile time, load time, and execution time.

9. [WEEK 04 - How to Map Files into Memory in C](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7E9piHcfr4) <br>
 This is a youtube video that explains about how to map files into memory in c language. You will understand the explanation easily because the speaker provides examples that the audience can easily understand.
 
10. [WEEK 05 - Virtual Memory](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qlH4-oHnBb8) <br>
Virtual Memory maps program address to RAM address. Virtual memory gives us flexibility in how we use the RAM.

12. [WEEK 05 - Thrashing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtyXZWp9Fsk) <br>
Thrashing is what happens when a program is spending more time paging than actually executing. This video explains what causes of thrashing and the solutions of it.

13. [WEEK 05 - Page Replacement Algorithm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XMVk5YA7vA) <br>
Page replacement algorithms decide which memory pages to page out, sometimes called swap out, or write to disk, when a page of memory needs to be allocated. Every different page replacement algorithms suggest different ways to decide which page to replace.

14. [WEEK 06 - Concurrency in Operating System](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/concurrency-in-operating-system/#:~:text=Concurrency%20is%20the%20execution%20of,shared%20memory%20or%20message%20passing.) <br>
This website contains information related to this week's material, which is about concurrency. Concurrency is the execution of the multiple instruction sequences at the same time. It happens in the operating system when there are several process threads running in parallel.

16. [WEEK 06 - Fork system call](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/fork-system-call/) <br>
This website explains about forks, their uses, and examples of how to use the fork function. The fork system call creates a new process. The new process created by fork() is a copy of the current process except for the returned value.

17. [WEEK 06 - What does Execlp do in C?](https://support.sas.com/documentation/onlinedoc/ccompiler/doc/lr2/execlp.htm) <br>
Like all of the exec functions, execlp replaces the calling process image with a new process image. This has the effect of running a new program with the process ID of the calling process.
