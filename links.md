4. [WEEK 02 - Pros and Cons of BYOD](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVNDl7ig1mk) <br>
An example of BYOD in real life is an employee who is allowed to use his personal device for both official work in the office and personal use. One of the benefits of implementing this policy is that BYOD can increase employee productivity, but on the other hand, if an employee loses his personal device, then attackers can easily get company information.
