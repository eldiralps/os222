1. [WEEK 00](https://www.notion.so/Lecture-01-Introduction-6a6c00684cc5412a93f430014a9a81e5#971b70590fad4c37861c4c37d0524b14)<br>
This site contains reading material that can help you a lot in review the first week's material. 
There are several sub-chapters such as what operating systems is, dual-mode operation, os structure, etc.

2. [WEEK 01](https://www.notion.so/Lecture-02-Virtual-Machines-b1c91dde244f43c686fd86fd9978abb8) <br>
In week 01, we learn about emulation, virtualisation, types of VMMs, Implementing Virtualisation, and Virtualisation Problems.
I highly recommend this site for those of you who have a penchant for learning through visuals like me.

3. [WEEK 02 - Types of Cyber Attacks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk-ZqQ-bfy4) <br>
This video will give you more information about the most common types of cyber attacks. Eight most frequently cyber threats in the world are malware, phishing, password attacks, DDoS, Man in the middle, drive-by download, malvertising, and rouge software.

4. [WEEK 02 - Pros and Cons of BYOD](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVNDl7ig1mk) <br>
An example of BYOD in real life is an employee who is allowed to use his personal device for both official work in the office and personal use. One of the benefits of implementing this policy is that BYOD can increase employee productivity, but on the other hand, if an employee loses his personal device, then attackers can easily get company information.

5. [WEEK 03 - File System Structure Articles](https://www.notion.so/Lecture-20-File-System-Structure-and-File-Links-f84da2a1bfe24d129f6e07620084ee68) <br>
Data about files and other info about storage on a device is called metadata. Usually, a disk device has one or more directories (or tables) to store metadata. These directories can be arranged in different ways such as single-level, two-level, tree stuctured, etc.

7. [WEEK 03 - Basic File Encryption](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMGIlj7u7Eo) <br>
This tutorial can help you to encrypt files with GPG key pairs.

8. [WEEK 04 - Memory Management](https://www.massey.ac.nz/~mjjohnso/notes/59305/mod8.html) <br>
Program must be brought into memory and placed within a process for it to be executed. The binding of instructions and data to the memory addresses can be done at any of the following steps of program execution which is complile time, load time, and execution time.

9. [WEEK 04 - How to Map Files into Memory in C](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7E9piHcfr4) <br>
 This is a youtube video that explains about how to map files into memory in c language. You will understand the explanation easily because the speaker provides examples that the audience can easily understand.
 
10. [WEEK 05 - Virtual Memory](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qlH4-oHnBb8) <br>
Virtual Memory maps program address to RAM address. Virtual memory gives us flexibility in how we use the RAM.

12. [WEEK 05 - Thrashing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtyXZWp9Fsk) <br>
Thrashing is what happens when a program is spending more time paging than actually executing. This video explains what causes of thrashing and the solutions of it.

13. [WEEK 05 - Page Replacement Algorithm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XMVk5YA7vA) <br>
Page replacement algorithms decide which memory pages to page out, sometimes called swap out, or write to disk, when a page of memory needs to be allocated. Every different page replacement algorithms suggest different ways to decide which page to replace.

14. [WEEK 06 - Concurrency in Operating System](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/concurrency-in-operating-system/#:~:text=Concurrency%20is%20the%20execution%20of,shared%20memory%20or%20message%20passing.) <br>
This website contains information related to this week's material, which is about concurrency. Concurrency is the execution of the multiple instruction sequences at the same time. It happens in the operating system when there are several process threads running in parallel.

16. [WEEK 06 - Fork system call](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/fork-system-call/) <br>
This website explains about forks, their uses, and examples of how to use the fork function. The fork system call creates a new process. The new process created by fork() is a copy of the current process except for the returned value.

17. [WEEK 06 - What does Execlp do in C?](https://support.sas.com/documentation/onlinedoc/ccompiler/doc/lr2/execlp.htm) <br>
Like all of the exec functions, execlp replaces the calling process image with a new process image. This has the effect of running a new program with the process ID of the calling process.

18. [WEEK 07 - Deadlock in OS](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-of-deadlock-in-operating-system/) <br>
Deadlock is a situation where a set of processes are blocked because each process is holding a resource and waiting for another resource acquired by some other process. Deadlock can arise if the following four conditions hold simultaneously

19. [WEEK 07 - Linux Kernel Programming](https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Linux-Kernel-Programming-Part-2) <br>
This repository contains code demonstrations for Linux Kernel Programming. I got this link from my friend that recommend me to rad topics related to this week topic.

20. [WEEK 08 - Preemptive and Non-Preemptive Scheduling](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DhFmL-6SDA) <br>
The striking difference between non-preemptive/cooperative scheduling and preemptive scheduling is in under non-preemptive/cooperative scheduling, once the CPU has been allocated, the process keeps the CPU until it releases it either by terminating or switching to the waiting state. Meanwhile, preemptive scheduling can result in race conditions, when data is shared among several processes. This can create inconsistent states in the data if two processes are updating/accessing the data at the same time.

22. [WEEK 08 - CPU Scheduling Algorithms](https://www.notion.so/Lecture-11-CPU-Scheduling-Algorithms-0dcfb5651d144b478d76788fbf1d5807) <br>
CPU scheduling deals with the problem of deciding which of the processes in the ready queue is to be allocated the CPU’s core. There are many different algorithms for this such as First-Come First-Served, Round Robid, etc. The site above contains a variety of scheduling, priority scheduling, handling piorities, multilevel queue scheduling and multiple-processor scheduling.

23. [WEEK 08 - Real-time CPU Scheduling](https://www.notion.so/Lecture-12-Real-time-CPU-Scheduling-4584438900fd4467a861afbcce04c3c5) <br>
For those of you who are still guessing about what scheduling is and how to calculate it, i recommend you to visit the website above because the summary is quite complete.

25. [WEEK 08 - LFS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ukLbyTTwGo&list=PLyc5xVO2uDsDlbR_LTP37nG6g4vbSSxSZ) <br>
This playlist video really helped me with my assignment this week. The speaker explained step by step clearly and referred to the book Linux From Scratch.

26. [WEEK 09 - LFS Ch.6](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0745lbRUGVE) <br>
This video will explain you step by step in working on the LFS book chapter 6 (Cross Compiling Temporary Tools). 

28. [WEEK 09 - LFS Ch.7](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzxqYGHcL2c) <br>
This video will explain you step by step in working on the LFS book chapter 7 (Entering Chroot and Building Additional Temporary Tools). 

30. [WEEK 09 - RAID Types](https://www.prepressure.com/library/technology/raid) <br>
RAID is a technology that is used to increase the performance and/or reliability of data storage. This site contains any explanation that will make you more familiar with the types of RAID such as RAID level 0, 1, 5, etc.

31. [WEEK 10 - LFS Ch.8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsPnrirvSnQ) <br>
This video will  will help you a lot in working on LFS chapter 8.

32. [WEEK 10 - I/O System and I/O Hardware](https://www.w3schools.in/operating-system/input-output) <br>
The controlling of various devices that are connected to the computer is a key concern of operating-system designers. This is because I/O devices vary so widely in their functionality and speed (for example a mouse, a hard disk and a CD-ROM), varied methods are required for controlling them. For more details, an explanation about i/o is in the link above.

33. [WEEK 10 - Kernel I/O Subsystem](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/kernel-i-o-subsystem-in-operating-system/) <br>
The kernel provides many services related to I/O. Several services such as scheduling, caching, spooling, device reservation, and error handling – are provided by the kernel. A more complete explanation of some of these services is in the link above.
